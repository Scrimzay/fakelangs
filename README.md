uhh this is just a filler upload, its way back when i tried making a language then it became a worse language, got the idea from a video, anyways, goofylang is the original then i got the idea to make a language that uses binary as a meme so then binarylang was birthed.
i dont know a single thing about lexers or parsers and i just tried because i thought itd be cool, used chatgpt for this back when it was still 3.5 OMEGALUL, anyways yea, if the code is rough not my fault, i dont know anything about making languages. dont plan on doing it again.
